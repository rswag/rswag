## Updating Swagger UI

Find the latest versions of swagger-ui here:
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/releases

Update the swagger-ui-dist version in the rswag-ui dependencies
```
./rswag-ui/package.json
```

Navigate to the rswag-ui folder and run npm install to update the package-lock.json


## Release
(for maintainers)

Update the changelog.md, putting the new version number in and moving the Unreleased marker.

Merge the changes into master you wish to release.

Add and push a new git tag, annotated tags preferred:
```
git tag -s 2.0.6 -m 'v2.0.6'
```

Travis will detect the tag and release all gems with that tag version number.
