# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest feature level of the latest major version is supported.
This is due to the size of the team.
At the current point in time this means 2.5.x

<!--
| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 2.5.x   | :white_check_mark: |

## Reporting a Vulnerability


<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability. -->
The Rswag team currently does not have a mailbox for security vulnerabilities. Please report discovered issues in the GitHub issues section, tagging public members.

<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc. -->
We will get back to the issue as soon as possible.
